# The Art of WebAssembly
Code repo for "The Art of WebAssembly" by Rick Battagline

# If your code is not compiling with wat2wasm
If you installed my npm package wat-wasm and it is not working for you, please update to version 1.0.43 or better.  

There was an issue with the version of wabt.js which should be fixed in later version.

Thanks,
Rick
